    Make Pipeline wait for connected inputs even if they're optional.

    So far Pipeline would not wait for an input coming from a connection that already has a default value.
    This PR modifies the behavior of the Pipeline to wait for such connections. This normally means that components
    that used to trigger earlier might now need to wait for other components to send their values before they could be
    run.

    For example, here is an affected pipeline:

    ```python
    @component
    class WithDefault:
        @component.output_types(c=int)
        def run(self, a: int, b: int = 2):
            return {"c": a + b}

    pipeline = Pipeline()
    pipeline.add_component("first", WithDefault())
    pipeline.add_component("second", WithDefault())
    pipeline.add_component("third", WithDefault())
    pipeline.connect("first", "second.a")
    pipeline.connect("second", "third.b")
    ```

    before, the order of execution would be `first -> third -> second`. From now on, it becomes
    `first -> second -> third`, because third is forced to wait for second to produce the value of `b` that it should
    use for the calculations.

    This change should only affect early misfiring of some components that, incorrectly, did not wait for some
    optional input values to be produced. However there might be corner cases which a correct order of execution is
    affected. If that is the case, please reference this PR on your issue: #6727
